It looks like initializing a repository is what adds the Git framework into the
directory, which allows for version control.

Being able to have complete control over which files get committed together
offers the developer the ability to be as specific as he/she wants to be
when constructing a commit.

The staging area is great for this fine level of control. It also allows for
comparison between the working directory, the staging area and the latest
commit.
