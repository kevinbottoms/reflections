It looks like initializing a repository is what adds the Git framework into the
directory, which allows for version control.

Being able to have complete control over which files get committed together
offers the developer the ability to be as specific as he/she wants to be
when constructing a commit.

The staging area is great for this fine level of control. It also allows for
comparison between the working directory, the staging area and the latest
commit.

Branching seems to be a good tool for either having multiple different versions
of a program or maybe some test ones. The ability to split and redirect
seems interesting.

The diagrams were very helpful in visualizing what and how Git is actually
doing what it does. After learning more about branching I think it is a great
way to do work alone and definitely with others.

Merging seems to be a great way for an individual to bring together two or more
versions or features, but is even better for multiple people working on a
project.

In the event that Git cannot figure out how to merge two files it will throw
and error, this conflict needs to be resolved before the merge can take place.
