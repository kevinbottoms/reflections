It seems to me that committing on your local computer gives a higher level of
control, while pulling from github can be good when multiple people are working
on a project, or when you are using more than one machine to develop.

Having GitHub pull all of the commits you make may release code to the public
(or other team members) before you would like to. The commit you made may be
a good place for you, but still not ready for release. Manual pushes help
prevent this.

The differences between clone and fork is subtle, basically a fork is done
on github and is a clone of someone else's repository. It is cloned to your
account and then you can mess with it starting from the last commit done by
its creator.

Merging seems to be something that I need to spend more time with. The power
of it seems clear, but I need some more hands on work with it. The advantage
to having the origins last known commit saved helps when there are multiple
people working on the same branch and they need to merge repositories.
